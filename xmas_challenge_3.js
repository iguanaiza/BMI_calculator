Christmas Challenge @wswieciekodu
     * Day 3.
     * Santa decided to enlist the help of modern technology this year.
     * Instead of buying a Christmas tree and ornaments, he decided to use those generated in the console (terminal).
     * Help Santa! Prepare the code that will write a Christmas tree on the screen.
     * If you can, do not write the tree directly in printy - mess with loops.
     * Prepare a function that takes the height of the Christmas tree and prints the tree on the screen.
     * So that the Christmas tree generates itself! The Christmas tree can simply be a triangle, or it can be composed of several layers. :)

/* TO FIX
function xmasTree(height) {

    for ( let x = 0 ; x < height; x++) {
        
        for ( let y = 0; y <= height * 2; y++) {
            
             if (x >= height - y && x >= y - height) {
                 
                 document.write("*");
                 
                } 
             
             else document.write(" ");
        }
        
    document.write("<br>");
