Few easy exercises with JavaScript

This folder exists because I wanted to do some easy things using JavaScript and I wanted to show it to my friends. I abandoned it for months, but now I decided to continue my work. 

The exercises are taken from different sources - the Udemy course, some Instagram challenges and more. I tried to describe them in each file.

I really have A LOT to learn, but I enjoy it, even if I have some hard times and doubts I still return to it.
